# Eye Exercise Project
> MIT xPRO - Week 14

This project was part of the course work required in the MIT xPRO Full-Stack development course taken.

## Description

A basic project to create a ToDo list. The list will enable a user to track tasks that they need to complete by adding the tasks to the list as well as clicking on a task to delete it once it is complete.

### Features

* A partially populated list desperately looking to be filled

## Installation

Clone the files that are in the ToDoList directory to your local machine.
A local server is needed to run the test React applications.
To do this complete the following steps:
- Download Live Server extension in VS code OR
- Download http-server via terminal using `npm install --global http-server` from https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
- Run a new terminal window within that folder and launch the React app via `http-server -c-1` 
- `-c-1` is used to stop the page from caching
- Once is it running, you can open your browser and navigate to the following site:
    - http://127.0.0.1:8080     
- To quit the application you can use `Ctrl + c`


## Usage

### Usage:
Life falling apart? Can't seem to get everything done? Are there too few hours in your days and oo few days in your life? Never fear, as this ToDo List is just about the answer to your every life problem. Simply add whatever task you need to do to the list and then go ahead and do it. BOOM! Problems solved. Life Sorted. 
Don't forget to delete the task after it is complete to stop yourself doing it again...

### Expected outcomes:
Fear.
Disbelief.
FREEDOM.

## Support

If by some unexpected circumstance the tasks stop tasking, please get hold of me at gman.international@gmail.com and I will make it all right again.

## Roadmap

Oh we have so many places to go... 
What starts off as tasks can end up as repeatable routines, and dare we even say projects.
Adding more detail to each task, adding sub tasks, adding grouping for different task lists, adding reminders, the list goes on.
And the best part about that is I have all the above potential additions saved where? You guessed it, my ToDo List!
